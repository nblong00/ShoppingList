# ShoppingList

Python scripts which allow a user to build a shopping list. Download all files in the repository and keep them in the same local directory for imports to establish correctly. Both 'ShoppingList.py' and 'utils' are mandatory. With that said, these scripts have the ability to create the 'script.log' and 'data.csv' files if you do not import them.

Below are the current commands of the program. Note that if the user does not input one of the below options, Python will interpret the input as needing to be added to the Shopping list. 

DONE - Exit the program.
HELP - Prints the 'Help Menu' for the user showing a list of avaiable commands.
LIST - Lists the current items & prices on the shopping list.
DELETE - Enter the name of item on shopping list and delete it from the list. If user correctly enters the name of an item, the shopping list will be returned without the inputted item.
